# Description 
This is a test task that I performed for the company eStoreLabs. Only HTML/CSS is implemented here.



### The first step is to download all the files of this repository. After unpack all the files and open them in the editor with the console
* If you have not used GULP, WEBPACK, and the NPM package manager up to this point, you should download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
Download the version recommended for most.
* If you have not used the GULP collector up to this point, enter the command **npm i gulp-cli -g**. This command will install GULP into the system globally.
 After GULP installation is complete, enter the command **npm i**.


### Dependency Error
If you receive an **ERR!** message red is a critical error and it needs to be corrected. To solve the problem, run the command **npm i --legacy-peer-deps**, this will start the installation process ignoring such incompatibilities.
Remember â€” the NodeJS and Python versions on your system must be new versions.

After successful installation, you will have the **node_modules** folder and the **package-lock.json** files.
Installation is complete.

### Template launch and operating modes
Developer mode. **npm run dev** startup command.


Good job. You've opened a project :)

Description

In this task I used:
- Font conversion ttf -->  woff and woff2 for faster loading (faster than a font link). 
- Optimization and compression of images into webp format.
- Grouping media queries, adding vendor prefixes (with using gulp)
- Mobile first merhod

I also made this task fully adaptable for all types of devices. At the same time I used media queries and in some cases mixins.

Importing images, preparing fonts and files - 1 - 1.5h.
HTML - 30-40 min.
CSS(SCSS) - ~ 2h.
